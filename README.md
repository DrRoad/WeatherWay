# WeatherWay
- WeatherWay was created to prevent accidents by using weather prediction with accidents history
- Nowadays there are many apps to help you move through the city faster. Time is money, right? NO
- Our algorithm joins multiple “The Weather Company” API’s with Car Accident Databases to answer a simple question:
- Would you arrive 20 minutes late to your meeting to save your life?
- WeatherWay provides you the safest route to your next appointment on a frictionless way
- Our algorithm works with a database of **115,572 accidents** were compared with **5 years of weather history** so we could know what areas of the city are affected by the weather on a way that causes accidents. Based on that, we trace a **better and safer route for you**


## Numbers on Weather-Related vehicle crashes
- There are nearly 1,312,000 crashes every year, which is 23% of the total vehicle accidents
- 6,250 people are killed and over 480,000 people are injured each year
- 74% of those crashes happen on wet pavement
- 46% during rainfall
- One of the top 20 causes for **truck accidents** involving **deaths and serious injuries**
- **Weather was a critical factor** in 20,000 crashes **involving large trucks** over a multi-year period.
- Trucking companies lose an estimated **32 billion vehicle hours** due to weather-related congestion

###Innovation: How innovative is the WeatherWay?
- Nowadays, GPS Apps only care about how fast you can get from place A to place B
- WeatherWay cares about **you** and **safety** by preventing accidents and suggesting least dangerous routes based on our **Big Data algorithm**

###Relevance: Does WeatherWay solve a real problem?
- Yearly, there are **more than 1 million vehicle crashes** and **6,250 deaths** where **wheater was a factor.**
- We offer a safer route based on analysis on **weather prediction**, a **5-year wheather history** and **more than 100 thousand car accidents** database

###Functionality: How functional is your code?
- DataCloud API to check if there is bad weather on each leg(Ex: Turn right on street), so we can **exatly** predict on from what part of your route weather is going to affect you
